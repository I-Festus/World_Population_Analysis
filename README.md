This project examines global population trends using Python for data analysis and visualization. With a dataset spanning 16 years, it provides valuable insights into population dynamics across various countries and regions.

# Objectives
Visualize the distribution of categorical and continuous variables, such as age distribution across populations.

# Tool and Libraries
## PYTHON
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlip & Seaborn For Visulaization

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA process, the following steps were performed:

Data Cleaning:
Addressed missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure dataset reliability.
Visualization:
Created bar charts and stacked charts to visualize the distribution of variables effectively.


# Targeted Analysis
1. Identified the top 10 populations in 2022.
2. Highlighted the bottom 10 populations in 2022.
3. Visualized the highest population by gender (male and female) using comparative charts.

# Insights
## Identified the top 10 populations in 2022.

- India and China are the most populous countries, each with over 1.4 billion people.  
- The United States ranks third, followed by Indonesia and Pakistan.  
- Nigeria is the only African country in the top 10, highlighting its demographic growth.  
- Brazil and Mexico represent the Americas in the list.  
- Russia and Bangladesh complete the top 10, with Bangladesh notable for its high population density.  
- Six out of the top 10 countries are in Asia, emphasizing the region's demographic dominance.  

## Highlighted the bottom 10 populations in 2022.

- Small island nations like Tuvalu, Nauru, Palau, and Marshall Islands dominate the list due to their limited land and resources.  
- European microstates such as Monaco, Liechtenstein, San Marino, and Gibraltar feature due to their small geographical size.  
- All countries have populations below 40,000, reflecting their minimal demographic impact.  
- Tuvalu is the least populated country on the list.  
- Dependency territories like the British Virgin Islands and St. Martin (French part) are also included.  
- These regions exhibit unique demographic patterns shaped by geographic isolation and economic contexts.

- India and China are the largest contributors to global population, with minimal gender disparity.
- Gender balance is consistent across most countries, except for Russia, where females outnumber males.
- Populations decrease significantly after the top three countries, highlighting the demographic gap.

- All countries have small, balanced populations with no significant gender disparity.
- Marshall Islands, Liechtenstein, and Monaco lead in population size among the listed nations.
- Tuvalu ranks the lowest in population, with fewer than 12,000 people.

# Conclusion 
This analysis offered a comprehensive understanding of population dynamics across various countries and regions. It serves as a foundation for deeper exploration and predictive modeling within the data science workflow.
